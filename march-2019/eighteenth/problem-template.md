## Prompt

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and
S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone
you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are
letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of
stone from "A".

__Example One__
```
Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
```

__Example Two__
```
Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
```

>Note: S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50. The characters in J are distinct.

### Starting Code (typed)

``` python
def numJewelsInStones(self, J: str, S: str) -> int:
    # put your algorithm here!
